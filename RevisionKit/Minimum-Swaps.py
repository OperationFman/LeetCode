# You are given an unordered array consisting of consecutive integers  [1, 2, 3, ..., n] 
# without any duplicates. You are allowed to swap any two elements. 
# Find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.

    # Clue: While loop until a sorted array matches what you're about to do
    # Go through with range(arr) -1 and do a bubble sort-style swap and incrmeent a counter
