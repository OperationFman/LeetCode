# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        pass
        # Originally you used a nested for loop O(n^2), try find a new way
        # Originally you iterated and ensuring the indexes wernt the same (To prevent the same value being calculated twice)
